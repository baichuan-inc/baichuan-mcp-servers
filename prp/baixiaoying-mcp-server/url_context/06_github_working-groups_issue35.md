## Problem Statement

Currently, MCP interactions are limited to text, images, and audio responses. This creates a significant limitation for building rich, interactive user experiences with MCP servers. The community has expressed strong interest in enabling UI components within tool responses to support complex workflows, forms, interactive data visualization, and guided user interactions.

### Specific Implementation Challenges

1.  **Limited Interaction Patterns**: Current MCP responses cannot support interactive forms, buttons, tables with sorting/filtering, or multi-step workflows
2.  **Custom DSL Proliferation**: Developers are creating ad-hoc solutions like JSONSchema-based forms or notification systems, leading to inconsistent approaches
3.  **Breaking MCP Contract**: Workarounds often require stepping outside the MCP protocol, reducing interoperability
4.  **Developer Experience**: Building meaningful interactive flows requires duplicating logic across tools and frontends

### Real-World Use Cases

- Interactive dashboards for system monitoring
- Dynamic forms for data collection and validation
- Step-by-step guided workflows
- Rich data visualization with user controls
- Multi-step approval processes

## Current State

A community member (idosal) has developed a working implementation:

- **Library**: `@mcp-ui/client` (experimental, community-maintained)
- **URI Scheme**: `ui://` and `ui-app://` for embedded resources
- **Implementation**: Fork of MCP Inspector with UI rendering capabilities

## Interests vs Positions

### Community Interests

- **Security**: Ensure UI rendering doesn't introduce XSS or injection vulnerabilities
- **Interoperability**: Maintain MCP protocol compatibility across implementations
- **Developer Experience**: Provide rich, interactive capabilities without breaking existing patterns
- **Standards**: Establish consistent approaches rather than fragmented solutions
- **Innovation**: Enable new categories of MCP applications and use cases

### Current Positions Being Advocated

- Official integration into MCP Inspector (rejected)
- Community fork maintenance approach (current)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility (proposed)
- Protocol-level UI support (under consideration)

## Related Work

- **Original PR Discussion**: [feat: support UI in Tool responses modelcontextprotocol/inspector#413](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/pull/413)
- **Community Implementation**: `@mcp-ui/client` library
- **Fork Maintenance**: `ui-inspector` community fork
- **Protocol Discussion**: Referenced in modelcontextprotocol/discussions/287

[@olaservo](https://github.com/olaservo) Definitely something that's needed. I was drafting [#34](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol-community/working-groups/pull/34), and we’ll need some sort of UI or flow for user consent. While it could technically be done entirely through an API, it feels like handling an MCP interaction outside of MCP.

One more thought w.r.t. deliverables: I think it'd be interesting to document "how the ui:// scheme works" so that, in theory, someone could build another SDK (e.g. in another language) or just leverage the scheme without an SDK. That scheme could be documented on the modelcontextprotocol-community org, and if people have ideas for other schemes we could create a library of Resource schemes over time.

100%. There's a description in mcp-ui exactly for that purpose but it's pretty basic. I'll formalize it soon and update here.

If you're up for it, thinking through how to present generically the "library of URI schemes" and basically introduce ui:// as the first example would be awesome

For image and audio types, we support `mimeType` on the data, though there may late be some generic "binary" types. Do we need extra client capabilities beyond the existing `mimeType` in order for clients to develop rich UI for editor data? It's possible that as a client I might have multiple ways (or my own extensions) to render given data. Versus just a generic "UI" scheme a mimetype would give me more specific ways to match on data.

We should definitely consider a way for the server to return different results or generic results, depending on the client's capabilities.

Even maybe something similar to mobile apps - where the basic UI building blocks are defined, and work well in every implementation.

The UI itself should probably be rendered by the client, but defined by the server

Proposing a new primitive for agent-UI coordination: event-driven, bidirectional communication between the UI and the agent runtime.

The current implementation, MCP-UI only allows UI → agent communication. Once the UI sends an event, the agent can respond only by re-rendering a new HtmlResourceBlock.

That is fine for static flows but painful for applications that need more input from the agent side during runtime. For example identity check, or tokens fetches.

Supported use cases can be using an agent wallet that fetches a payment token, or oAuth credentials (without handling the logic within the iframe re-rendering and opening new windows).

Would love to hear anyones thoughts.

Hi [@Idan-Levin](https://github.com/Idan-Levin), thanks for this use case proposal!

Also responded here: [MCP-UI-Org/mcp-ui#27 (comment)](https://github.com/MCP-UI-Org/mcp-ui/discussions/27#discussioncomment-13680524)

mcp-ui is being built on top of the standard, to provide implementation for UI communication between MCP servers and hosts. As the standard is aiming to be unopinionated as possible, we can use mcp-ui to explore different directions.

There are good cases for bi-directional communication, and while we have considered it we want to try to avoid creating two separate streams of communication - one in the main conversation flow, and one in messaging in and out of the iframe (the latter is also not persisted in the conversation or in future context). This is why for now mcp-ui supports uni-directional messaging, and the agent decides what to do next.

That being said an elicitation-like flow, or even a standard message channel for one-time transient data (like payment info), could be good approaches.

We will be happy to collaborate more on your use cases to try and generalize some of the ideas.

Thanks again!

bidirectional communication between the UI and the agent runtime is also very useful to keep the agent informed/aware the user is doing somehting in the ui (e.g. filling.a form, ) so the agent can bring things to the user's attention and vice-versa, enabling a symbiotic outcome co-creation between user and agent within the same conversation.

A missing piece is session continuity and event-driven updates. Many real-world workflows (orders, tickets, support) need the server to:

• Provide context when a chat opens (e.g. last order/ticket status).

• Push updates back into the same conversation (e.g. “order shipped,” “product not found”), even if the user isn’t active.

• Support a simple subscribe/notify pattern so clients can decide whether to show updates as chat, UI blocks, or push notifications.

Without this, developers will invent their own webhook/polling solutions, which risks fragmentation. Standardizing an event channel, capability negotiation (UI vs text fallback), and consent for background updates would make MCP much more useful in real business flows.

I completely agree. Integrating the user's actions into the agentic flow is one of the most important aspects of agentic UI.

We see it in the wild with the MCP-UI community SDK through the `notify` UI action. Other message types extend communication to active follow-ups. For example, apps can convey user intent to be carried out by the agent (e.g., prompting, tool calling) or to request information from the host, unlocking new complex flows that don't require hard-coded API integrations between apps.
